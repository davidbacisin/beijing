		<h2>Welcome to Beijing</h2>
		<p>It is 3:23 pm. I’ve just gotten off a 12 ½ hour flight from 
		Chicago, after learning what a <q>short-checked bag</q> is and 
		stepping onto a Boeing<nbsp/>747 for the first time. I had spent
		an hour and a half waiting for my luggage to show up from my 
		Cleveland flight, grabbed a quarter-pounder with cheese for 
		lunch from McDonald’s, and gotten my visa approved with a 
		DOCS<nbsp/>OK stamp at the gate. Now that I was here, I had no 
		idea where to go, but I let my aching legs follow the crowd of
		people along hundreds of meters of terminal walkway.</p>
		
		<p>I wondered how the plane could see to land as I looked out 
		the expansive windows of Beijing Capital: the outside air was 
		yellowish-white with smog. Still walking, walking, looking for a 
		sign with English<mdash/>and finally the ceiling swelled upward
		and there were the lines. I scanned the signs. Chinese nationals, 
		no, diplomatic, no, immigration, possibly, transits out of this 
		terminal, no, transits out a different terminal, still no, no 
		more planes right now please<mdash/>so I got in the long line 
		for immigration. I filled out the immigration card, posed for a
		picture, and got stamped through.</p>
		
		<t:tip>US Citizens must apply in advance for a Chinese visa. This 
		could take a week or two, and I would recommend applying even a 
		month before you leave to avoid expidite fees.</t:tip>
		
		<p>Once again wandering and wondering, I spotted a sign that said 
		<q>Baggage claim: Take train to T3.</q> Train? TRAIN?
		I took the escalator past the sign and sure enough, light rail 
		trains were carting people off the platform<mdash/>but judging 
		by a few others’ facial expressions, I wasn’t the only one 
		confused by the whole system. I piled onto the next train, 
		wondered who was driving because I sure didn’t see a place for 
		a driver to sit, and then arrived at Terminal 3. There was a 
		disturbing lack of signs for baggage claim.</p>
		
		<p>I once again followed the crowd, this time into another huge 
		room with the largest and longest bag carousels I had ever 
		seen<mdash/>not that I’ve seen all that many. After 15 minutes 
		I spotted my bag and yanked it from the pile, and headed over to
		something that looked like an exit…but only sort of. It said 
		customs, but not a lot of people were going through it<mdash/>I 
		read the signs and glanced around, and there, a hundred meters 
		away on the other side of the room, was the very large customs 
		signs, with a much longer line of people. I rolled over, 
		double-checked the signs to make sure I had nothing to declare, 
		and then stepped through the metal detectors and sent my 
		baggage through the X-ray scanner. Getting no response from the 
		security personnel (was it OK to go?) I loitered a few seconds 
		and then decided to continue on, through a maze of hallways 
		until<mdash/></p>
		
		<p>Railings groaned as they held back hundreds of people, like 
		levees in a hurricane. As I walked I saw faces, signs, more faces and more 
		signs, but no one I recognized and none with my name. I was 
		supposed to call the person<mdash/>whom I’d never met<mdash/>who
		was to pick me up from the airport, but I certainly didn’t have 
		cell service. Finally, as I came to the end of the parted sea,
		I heard someone say,</p>
		
		<p><q>David?</q></p>
		
		<p>I looked up and saw one familiar face, a face I had seen only 
		once before in a picture from a conference call: Michael. Michael
		introduced me to the person standing next to him, Jesse, who 
		was the one picking the both of us Americans from the 
		airport<mdash/>a last minute change, since I was originally 
		supposed to meet with Chen. C’est la vie.</p>
		
		<p>Jesse led us to his car, and his driver<mdash/>yes, this 
		Chinese twentysomething had a driver<mdash/>shimmied us through 
		traffic to our destination: the Haidian district.</p>
		
		<p>The next day I find out that Jesse has a driver because his 
		family works in the government. Oh, I see….</p>
		
		<h2>Crosstown traffic</h2>
		<img src="/beijing/traffic.jpg" />
		<p>Beijing has the craziest traffic I’ve ever experienced: 6 lanes 
		each direction, packed with cars, trucks, taxis, motorbikes, 
		rickshaws, bicycles…and they all weave through each other with a 
		bit of horn-honking, yelling, but rarely any collisions. It seemed 
		all very hectic at first, but within a few days I realized how 
		remarkably predictable it all was: big things get right-of-way
		and everything else wiggles between.</p>
		
		<h2>“Silicon Valley”</h2>
		<p>We got out of the car at our hotel near Renmin University.
		I felt surprised at the strange sweetness as I breathed for 
		the first time the thick, polluted air. The sun was a dull 
		orange disc, dim enough to look at due to the yellowish smog.</p>
		
		<p>We walked to Zhongguancun, where steel and glass shimmer in 
		every direction. Surrounded by China’s top institutions of 
		higher education, including Renmin, Peking, and Tsinghua 
		Universities, we were in a place often called <q>the Silicon 
		Valley of China.</q> This was where I’d be spending most of my 
		time, teaching human-centered design to college students from 
		all over China.</p> 
		
		<p>With the summer sun and humid air steaming me like a pork 
		and cabbage dumpling, I wandered through Zhongguancun’s maze 
		of skyscrapers and urban parks. On Sunday, parents sat in the 
		shade of <!-- TODO type of tree --> as they watched their 
		children learn to speedskate in Zhongguancun Plaza. I wandered 
		up the hillside garden that led to an expansive patio over 
		the road below. Between the many floors of the Gate<nbsp/>City 
		and EC<nbsp/>Malls and the Ding<nbsp/>Hao Electronics Center,
		there was plenty of air-conditioned indoor space to cool off, 
		grab a bite to eat, and gain the attention of ravenous solicitors
		selling electronics of every sort.</p>
		
		<h2>Transportation: subway</h2>
		<p>A ride on Line<nbsp/>4 with a transfer to Line<nbsp/>1 took 
		Ge, Michael, and I to The Palace Museum, better known by 
		Westerners as The Forbidden City. First step? Security.</p>
		
		<p>Every subway station has an X-ray machine, through which you’re 
		asked to put any bags you’re carrying. If you left a water bottle 
		in your bag, the security personnel will ask you to remove it 
		and hand it over for them to test in another sensor machine of
		some sort. Alternatively, you can just carry the water bottle 
		and visibly take a sip, I guess to show that it’s not some 
		dangerous chemical. Some stations also have walk-through metal 
		detectors, followed by personnel to pat you down with handheld 
		detectors. Security.</p>
		
		<p>The turnstiles part with a wave of the card. Beijing’s subway 
		fare system varies by distance traveled, with a minimum charge 
		of 3 yuan and a maximum of 8. Even after a 50<nbsp/>minute ride 
		across the city, I had only spent 6 yuan, about 1 US dollar.</p>
		
		<p>The wide platforms accomodate rush hour crowds, and many of 
		the newer stations have glass walls lining the 
		tracks<mdash/>quite appreciated when a train flies alongside a 
		packed platform. Many platforms even seemed to have bathrooms!</p>
		
		<p>And then the trains. With wide trains and lots of places to 
		hold, the trains are comfortable during the quiet midday and 
		not bad at rush hour depending on whether or not you believe 
		in the <q>personal bubble.</q> TV screens show public 
		announcements and stops, and ads can be watched through 
		the train windows, projected onto the tunnel walls. Maps of 
		the line above each door have LED indicators for the current, 
		next, and upcoming stations. Announcements are thankfully 
		in Mandarin and English.</p>
		
		<p>With the high chance of traffic jams and general lack of 
		car, the subway became my main form of transportation around 
		Beijing.</p>

		<h2>Traditional architecture: The Palace Museum and Summer Palace</h2>
		<p>We came out of the subway and saw little besides a line of 
		people and a security checkpoint<mdash/>but once through, there 
		it was: Tiananmen with a massive portrait of none other than 
		Mao Zedong. We weaved through the many (mostly Chinese) tourists,
		stopping occasionally to take pictures.</p>
		
		too hot and tired to explore the entirety of either place, 
			each on separate days
		central axis, tend to keep going forward and not turn around to 
			avoid looking suspicious
		high walls
		drooped lion ears
		giant pots
		raised thresholds
		wooden framing
		painted eaves
		cramming around a railing to see a throne room; lots of selfies 
			and selfie sticks
		the peacefulness of the garden; private for romance
		maze of corridors, palaces, rooms
		need a passport or ID to buy a ticket, 130 yuan (?)
		moat around the palace
		
		purpose of the summer palace
		60 yuan (?) for entry plus the special exhibits
		many stairs, about 260 (?) from lake to temple of fragrant buddha
		we mostly only explored Longevity Hill
		fusion of temples, gardens, pavilions immersed in forests, shops 
			along a canal
		the long corridor
		Kunming Lake
		? best example of Chinese gardens?
		
		rock statues
		bonsai
		
		<h2>Transportation: Rickshaw</h2>
		<p>Ken and I were headed to meet Chen, Ge, and Mandy for dinner.
		After a long day of walking on the hottest day yet, we decided 
		to catch a cab once off the subway<mdash/>but several cabbies 
		waved us away. As we returned to the sidewalk, an older man 
		hailed us from his rickshaw: we looked at each other, decided that 
		his price of 60 yuan was far too much, and started mapping how 
		to walk. Not giving up so easily, the man called us 
		again<mdash/>we haggled<mdash/>and a few minutes later we were 
		careening down a car-packed street for 30 yuan. He shouted some 
		words to squeeze through a jam, turned down a narrow alley, and 
		dropped us off, right in front of the restaurant! (Who puts a 
		restaurant down an alley? A lot of places in China, that’s for 
		sure!) We tipped him an extra 10.</p>
		
		<h2>Life in a Hutong</h2>
		<p>Speaking of alleys, the Chinese word for alley is hutong.</p>
		
		<h2>Transportation: Chairlift and Toboggan</h2>
		
		<h2>The Great Wall at Mutianyu</h2>
		
		<h2>Transportation: van and bus</h2>
		
		<h2>Interlude</h2>
		<h3>Money</h3>
		<h3>Food and water</h3>
		
		<h2>Olympic parks</h2>
