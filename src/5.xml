		<h2>Back to Beijing</h2>
		<p>The Great Wall is not our only adventure today: while 
		our friends had set up the carpool <em>to</em> Mutianyu, they have no 
		plan for getting back. After learning from the Welcome Center 
		staff that the next bus would be a while, we wander out and 
		soon encounter an older man soliciting rides into town. Mandy 
		and Jenny speak with him (Ken and I clueless to what is 
		happening), and soon enough we are climbing into the back of a 
		small van. Before we pull onto the road, the driver shouts for 
		and negotiates with another passenger, who takes the front seat.</p>
		
		<p>The ride is certainly fast. Our driver races through the 
		countryside, passing cars on the left <em>and</em> the 
		right<mdash/>and then slamming on the brakes while passing 
		in the <q>bike</q> lane because, well, there’s a farmer 
		chugging along on a motorized cargo tricycle. But, we make it 
		into town in one piece, pay the driver his 40<nbsp/>yuan, and 
		we get off on the side of the road. He points to the other side 
		of the street, telling us that the crowd there is waiting for 
		the bus.</p>
		
		<p>Despite not a single sign for a bus stop.</p>
		
		<p>We wait for about 15<nbsp/>minutes and sure enough, a public 
		bus arrives! Being mid-afternoon on a Sunday (or maybe just 
		being in Beijing) means that our bus gets stuck in traffic for 
		two hours on the Jingcheng Expressway. Finally, miraculously, 
		we find a subway station. Just over three hours after leaving 
		the Great Wall, we’re back in Zhongguancun.</p>

		<h3>Food</h3>
		<p>I tried a lot of food while in China. Most of it was delicious.
		Some of it was not.</p>
		
		<p>Breakfast usually consists of rice porridge with 
		steamed buns and tea eggs<mdash/>hard-boiled eggs that have been 
		cracked and brewed in a mixture of tea and soy sauce. I’m sad 
		I didn’t try this until the end of the second week, because it 
		was pretty darn tasty.</p>
		
		<p>Instead, for breakfast I typically went to one of the 
		8<nbsp/>bakeries between my hotel and Zhongguancun. And by 8, I 
		literally mean 8: Meetmatzo, Paris Baguette, With Wheat…but I 
		don’t remember the names of the others because they were written
		only in Chinese. A lot of loaves have a filling of some sort, 
		which can be a surprise when you’re not expecting it. Pretty 
		much everything was delicious.</p>
		
		<t:image src="with-wheat.jpg" portrait="yes">This loaf from With 
		Wheat has pesto chicken baked inside.</t:image>
		
		<p>Most meals in China seem to involve rice. Rice is great. 
		Rice is tasty. Rice is versatile. But sometimes, you’ve just 
		had enough rice for the day. Ken, Karen, and I all got this 
		same feeling one day, and I remembered that there was a pizza 
		place nearby. We really enjoyed the cheese, sauce, and 
		crust that evening.</p>
		
		<t:image src="pizza.jpg">Tube Station has the <q>biggest pizza
		in Beijing.</q> It’s literally their slogan, and I don’t doubt 
		its truth. This medium pizza is at least 20<nbsp/>inches in 
		diameter, and their large is probably 30 or more.</t:image>
		
		<p>Ken and I were ordering lunch one day and wanted it for 
		takeout. Like usual, we pointed at the picture menus to order, 
		but then we needed to communicate that we wanted to eat 
		elsewhere. We resorted to translating <q>takeout</q> on a 
		smartphone, but we later asked a friend. She suggested we say
		<q>dǎ bāo,</q> which means <q>in a bag.</q> It worked! Though 
		we quickly adopted into English:</p>
		
		<p><q>Where’d you get that? It looks good.</q></p>
		
		<p><q>Oh, I dabao’d it from that one place with the green signs.</q></p>
		
		<p>One night, Jenny and Claire took us design mentors and faculty
		out for a fancy dinner of traditional Beijing food. It was a 
		beautifully decorated restaurant with very good food. Jenny and 
		Claire ordered 10<nbsp/>dishes to share amongst 8 people. A few 
		of them are shown in the gallery below.</p>

			<t:image src="date-cake.jpg">A mildly sweet date cake</t:image>
			<t:image src="steamed-veggies.jpg">Some colorful steamed 
			veggies with mushrooms and red kidney beans</t:image>
			<t:image src="beef-tendon.jpg">When you cook beef tendon for 
			a long time, it becomes gelatinous and smooth, like a big piece 
			of fat. I didn’t like the texture, or the way it flopped 
			around.</t:image>
			<t:image src="gelatinous-rice.jpg">On the other hand, the 
			gelatinous rice bars were quite good in both flavor and 
			texture. Rice becomes gelatinous after you cook and pound 
			it enough.</t:image>
			<t:image src="eggplant.jpg">A delicious eggplant dish</t:image>
			<t:image src="roast-duck.jpg">At the end of the meal, we were
			served the roast duck. You take a circular rice wrapper (top),
			dip a slice of duck in the soy sauce, and put that slice in 
			the middle of the wrapper with a few pieces of cucumber and 
			green onion. Then you wrap it up and eat it! The sugar (center 
			bowl) is for dipping the fatty roast skin into, if you like.</t:image>
