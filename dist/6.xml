		Here are some of the other highlights from 
		my food experience — or at least those of which I took a 
		picture:</p><ul class="gallery" id="f1IG"><li><span class="caption">Bibimbap is Korean and is a mix

			soup (bottom) and plum juice (yellow cup) helped tame the heat.</span> <a target="_blank" href="/assets/images/hotpot.jpg" class="image-link p">View image</a></li><li><span class="caption">At Suzuki Kitchen, a

		program organizers told me when I arrived.</p><p>One of the most frustrating parts of my experience in China 
		was the fact that the tap water just isn’t safe to drink. 
		The reason? It contains a delightful mix of bacteria and heavy 
		metals.</p><p>Some people drink boiled tap water, but boiling doesn’t 
		take care of the heavy metals — so I spent a considerable amount 
		of time and money going to the store to buy bottled water. I was 
		quite happy to discover the 1.5 liter bottles, which are 
		a little big to carry around but well worth the saved money 
		and effort: I drank about 2 liters total per day, meaning I had 
		to only buy one or two 1.5 L bottles at 3.5 yuan.
		Before I had discovered the big bottles, I was going through 
		about 4 bottles at 2.5 yuan each.</p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container p"></div><figcaption>After not even a full day, I 
		had already downed these 4 small bottles.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/water-bottles.jpg">View image</a></figure><p>I never buy bottled water in the States because one, it costs 
		anywhere from 300 to 2000 times more than tap water; two, the 
		tap water in northeast Ohio (where I live) regularly exceeds 
		health and safety standards; and three, all of those extra 
		bottles are extremely wasteful, even if they are recycled. 
		Recycling helps, but it still takes a lot of energy to process
		all that plastic! Having worked on several environmental 
		sustainability projects in the past, I felt like I was just 
		<em>slaughtering</em> the environment with how many bottles I 
		bought in China. Sob.</p></div><div class="subsection dust"><h3>Smog</h3><p>On that note, the smog was probably tied for the most
		frustrating part of my experience. I could actually <em>see</em>
		it through the window when I arrived, but I didn’t <em>smell</em>
		it until I finally got out of the air conditioning. It was 
		heavy to breathe, and sweet — sweet in a way 
		you don’t ever want air to be, sweet with a mix of car exhaust 
		and cigarette smoke. Those first few days were probably the worst
		out of my three weeks, since a rainstorm on the fourth day 
		cleared up the sky quite a bit.</p><p>Beijing is particularly prone to dense smog because the city 
		is surrounded by a mountain range that tends to block the 
		wind — not to mention the population over 20 million and 
		traffic jams caused by the roughly 6 million registered cars. 
		Very few people wear breathing masks, and even I started to get 
		used to breathing the air after a few days. I’d rather not 
		think about all the pollution I inhaled.</p></div><div class="subsection"><h3>Money</h3><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>Colorful yuan notes in denominations of 
		1, 10, 20, 50, and 100, as well as a 5 jiao note, 
		1 yuan coins, and 1 and 5 jiao coins.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/money.jpg">View image</a></figure><p>The currency of the People’s Republic of China is the 
		renminbi, meaning <q>people’s currency</q> and abbreviated 
		<abbr title="renminbi">RMB</abbr>. The <em>yuan</em> (元) is the 
		base unit; there are 10 jiao (角) to 1 yuan; and 
		there are 10 fen (分) to 1 jiao. I never saw any 
		prices or coins in terms of fen, probably because they have so little 
		value. Today, the exchange rate fluctuates between 6 to 7 yuan 
		per 1 United States dollar — but with that in mind, 
		the cost of living in China is also considerably lower.
		A regular 18-ounce bottle of water is typically priced at 2 or 
		3 yuan, or 30 to 46 US cents.</p></div></section><section class="blue last"><svg aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 1200 300" fill="currentColor"><path xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" d="m 795.4,70.66 c -45,0 -82.3,33.34 -88.2,76.54 5.9,0.8 11.7,2.3 17.2,4.4 4.2,-35.6 34.2,-63.14 71,-63.14 39.4,0 71.1,31.64 71.1,71.24 0,39.4 -31.7,71.1 -71.1,71.1 -32.2,0 -59.2,-21 -68.1,-50 -6.2,-3.4 -13,-5.7 -19.8,-6.9 6.8,42.4 43.6,74.8 87.9,74.8 49.1,0 89,-40 89,-89 0,-49.1 -39.9,-89.04 -89,-89.04 z" id="or"></path><path xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" d="m 697.4,150.8 c -1.5,0 -2.9,0 -4.2,0.1 0.2,3 0.5,5.9 0.5,8.9 0,3 -0.3,6 -0.5,8.9 1.3,-0.1 2.7,-0.1 4.2,-0.1 31.9,0 58.9,20.8 67.9,49.8 6.2,3.4 12.9,6 20,7.4 -6.8,-42.6 -43.6,-75 -87.9,-75 z m -30.7,5.4 c -34,12.5 -58.4,45.2 -58.4,83.5 0,49.1 39.9,89 89.1,89 44.7,0 81.8,-33 88,-76 -5.8,-0.7 -11.8,-1.9 -17.5,-3.8 -4.4,35.1 -34.2,62.1 -70.5,62.1 -39.5,0 -71.3,-31.9 -71.3,-71.3 0,-27.4 15.5,-51.2 38.2,-63.1 1.6,-5.4 2.5,-11 2.5,-16.8 0,-1.1 0,-2.4 -0.1,-3.6 z" id="ir"></path><use xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" x="-392" y="0" transform="rotate(259,404,160)" xlink:href="#or"></use><use xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" transform="matrix(-1,0,0,-1,1297,400)" xlink:href="#ir"></use><use xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" x="-196" y="0" xlink:href="#ir"></use></svg><a name="Olympic-Parks" aria-hidden="true"></a><h2>Olympic Parks</h2><p>Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics.
