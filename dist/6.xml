		program organizers told me when I arrived.</p><p>One of the most frustrating parts of my experience in China 
		was the fact that the tap water just isn’t safe to drink. 
		The reason? It contains a delightful mix of bacteria and heavy 
		metals.</p><p>Some people drink boiled tap water, but boiling doesn’t 
		take care of the heavy metals — so I spent a considerable amount 
		of time and money going to the store to buy bottled water. I was 
		quite happy to discover the 1.5 liter bottles, which are 
		a little big to carry around but well worth the saved money 
		and effort: I drank about 2 liters total per day, meaning I had 
		to only buy one or two 1.5 L bottles at 3.5 yuan.
		Before I had discovered the big bottles, I was going through 
		about 4 bottles at 2.5 yuan each.</p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container p"></div><figcaption>After not even a full day, I 
		had already downed these 4 small bottles.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/water-bottles.jpg">View image</a></figure><p>I never buy bottled water in the States because one, it costs 
		anywhere from 300 to 2000 times more than tap water; two, the 
		tap water in northeast Ohio (where I live) regularly exceeds 
		health and safety standards; and three, all of those extra 
		bottles are extremely wasteful, even if they are recycled. 
		Recycling helps, but it still takes a lot of energy to process
		all that plastic! Having worked on several environmental 
		sustainability projects in the past, I felt like I was just 
		<em>slaughtering</em> the environment with how many bottles I 
		bought in China. Sob.</p></div><div class="subsection dust"><h3>Smog</h3><p>On that note, the smog was probably tied for the most
		frustrating part of my experience. I could actually <em>see</em>
		it through the window when I arrived, but I didn’t <em>smell</em>
		it until I finally got out of the air conditioning. It was 
		heavy to breathe, and sweet — sweet in a way 
		you don’t ever want air to be, sweet with a mix of car exhaust 
		and cigarette smoke. Those first few days were probably the worst
		out of my three weeks, since a rainstorm on the fourth day 
		cleared up the sky quite a bit.</p><p>Beijing is particularly prone to dense smog because the city 
		is surrounded by a mountain range that tends to block the 
		wind — not to mention the population over 20 million and 
		traffic jams caused by the roughly 6 million registered cars. 
		Very few people wear breathing masks, and even I started to get 
		used to breathing the air after a few days. I’d rather not 
		think about all the pollution I inhaled.</p></div><div class="subsection"><h3>Money</h3><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/money.jpg">View image</a></figure><p>The currency of the People’s Republic of China is the 
		renminbi, meaning <q>people’s currency</q> and abbreviated 
		<abbr title="renminbi">RMB</abbr>. The <em>yuan</em> (元) is the 
		base unit; there are 10 jiao (角) to 1 yuan; and 
		there are 10 fen (分) to 1 jiao. I never saw any 
		prices or coins in terms of fen, probably because they have so little 
		value. Today, the exchange rate fluctuates between 6 to 7 yuan 
		per 1 United States dollar — but with that in mind, 
		the cost of living in China is also considerably lower.
		A regular 18-ounce bottle of water is typically priced at 2 or 
		3 yuan, or 30 to 46 US cents.</p></div></section><section class="blue"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 1200 300" fill="currentColor"><path d="m 795.4,70.66 c -45,0 -82.3,33.34 -88.2,76.54 5.9,0.8 11.7,2.3 17.2,4.4 4.2,-35.6 34.2,-63.14 71,-63.14 39.4,0 71.1,31.64 71.1,71.24 0,39.4 -31.7,71.1 -71.1,71.1 -32.2,0 -59.2,-21 -68.1,-50 -6.2,-3.4 -13,-5.7 -19.8,-6.9 6.8,42.4 43.6,74.8 87.9,74.8 49.1,0 89,-40 89,-89 0,-49.1 -39.9,-89.04 -89,-89.04 z" id="or"></path><path d="m 697.4,150.8 c -1.5,0 -2.9,0 -4.2,0.1 0.2,3 0.5,5.9 0.5,8.9 0,3 -0.3,6 -0.5,8.9 1.3,-0.1 2.7,-0.1 4.2,-0.1 31.9,0 58.9,20.8 67.9,49.8 6.2,3.4 12.9,6 20,7.4 -6.8,-42.6 -43.6,-75 -87.9,-75 z m -30.7,5.4 c -34,12.5 -58.4,45.2 -58.4,83.5 0,49.1 39.9,89 89.1,89 44.7,0 81.8,-33 88,-76 -5.8,-0.7 -11.8,-1.9 -17.5,-3.8 -4.4,35.1 -34.2,62.1 -70.5,62.1 -39.5,0 -71.3,-31.9 -71.3,-71.3 0,-27.4 15.5,-51.2 38.2,-63.1 1.6,-5.4 2.5,-11 2.5,-16.8 0,-1.1 0,-2.4 -0.1,-3.6 z" id="ir"></path><use x="-392" y="0" transform="rotate(259,404,160)" xlink:href="#or"></use><use transform="matrix(-1,0,0,-1,1297,400)" xlink:href="#ir"></use><use x="-196" y="0" xlink:href="#ir"></use></svg><a name="Olympic-Parks" aria-hidden="true"></a><h2>Olympic Parks</h2><p>Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics.

		I decide to spend a morning exploring the 680-hectare Olympic 
		Forest Park. It is cloudy today, with a forecast for rain, 
		so I suspect it will be less popular than usual. I, however, 
		have a very enjoyable time wandering around by myself.</p><p>Along the edge of the large, southern lake of the park, a few 
		people are feeding the koi fish — and what a strange 
		sight it is! Hundreds of fish swarm all into one spot, 
		some of them rising much further above the surface of the water 
		than I ever would have expected.</p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>Koi swarm near the edge of the 
		lake, where people are tossing food pellets.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/koi-frenzy.jpg">View image</a></figure><p>After recovering from my shock at the fish frenzy, I start 
		walking around the lake when the dull whirring sound I’d 
		been hearing could no longer be considered <q>dull.</q> Turning 
		down one path, it sounds like a million insects chirping, 
		singing…shrieking? The whirr is loud enough to be painful, yet 
		pleasant: for a moment I forget that I’m in a bustling, smoggy
		city. I suspect the sound comes from cicadas, but after looking 
		and looking I never spot one while hearing the sound. Several 
		other areas throughout the park also whirr with gusto.</p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>I did manage to catch a photo of this 
		bug, though I didn’t hear any whirring at the time.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/bug.jpg">View image</a></figure><p>After about half an hour, I keep noticing all sorts of 
		prohibitory signs that are simultaneously intrusive and
		entertaining. They say things like, <q>No littering,</q><q>No fires permitted in garden,</q><q>No swimming,</q><q>No stepping on the ice,</q><q>No climbing,</q>
		and my favorite, <q>No picking and digging fruit and wild 
		vegetable.</q></p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>You can rent a cool motorized cart

		overlooks the lake. Why not, with a name like <!-- TODO name of hill -->.
		Unlike the highly-maintained areas that I have just walked through,
		the path up the hill has been left to be (slightly) more wild.
		The aroma of pine trees wash over me as I pass through a 
		grove, and I stop at the first landing for a short time — but,
		the trees are too tall to see over and I don’t want to disturb 
		the woman doing yoga, so I continue up the path. By the top, 
		I am even sweatier than I had been at the Great Wall, but it 
		is well-worth the view of the Olympic Green and city beyond.</p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>A hazy view from the top of

		toward the subway stop, getting slightly lost in the extensive
		serpentine paths of the park. At one point, I cross paths with 
		a mother and her son — and after about a minute of them 
		conversing in Chinese while I take pictures of the scenery, he 
		runs over to me to say <q>Hello!</q> His (English) name is Jack 
		and he is 8 years old; and I think he was very excited to practice 
		his English with a foreigner. It’s a great way to end my adventure.</p><aside><h4>Traveler’s Tip.</h4> The Olympic Green and Forest Park are accessible via 
		4 stops along line 8 of the subway. While the sports

		The design program ended Saturday and everyone has left, but at

		8:00 am Tuesday, I need to find a way to the 
		airport — but the subway opening at 6 am will be too late.</p><p>Hacking together a translation, I show the hotel

		enough and that my VPN won’t cut out. (A Virtual Private 
		Network is needed to access a number of Western websites, 
		including Google, because of <q>The Great Firewall.</q>)
		A few badly translated words from the receptionist’s phone
