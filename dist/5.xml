		our friends had set up the carpool <em>to</em> Mutianyu, they have no 
		plan for getting back. After learning from the Welcome Center 
		staff that the next bus would be a while, we wander out and 
		soon encounter an older man soliciting rides into town. Mandy 
		and Jenny speak with him (Ken and I clueless to what is 
		happening), and soon enough we are climbing into the back of a 
		small van. Before we pull onto the road, the driver shouts for 
		and negotiates with another passenger, who takes the front seat.</p><p>The ride is certainly fast. Our driver races through the 
		countryside, passing cars on the left <em>and</em> the 
		right — and then slamming on the brakes while passing 
		in the <q>bike</q> lane because, well, there’s a farmer 
		chugging along on a motorized cargo tricycle. But, we make it 
		into town in one piece, pay the driver his 40 yuan, and 
		we get off on the side of the road. He points to the other side 
		of the street, telling us that the crowd there is waiting for 
		the bus.</p><p>Despite not a single sign for a bus stop.</p><p>We wait for about 15 minutes and sure enough, a public 
		bus arrives! Being mid-afternoon on a Sunday (or maybe just 
		being in Beijing) means that our bus gets stuck in traffic for 
		two hours on the Jingcheng Expressway. Finally, miraculously, 
		we find a subway station. Just over three hours after leaving 
		the Great Wall, we’re back in Zhongguancun.</p></section><section class="last"><svg aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 1200 300" fill="currentColor"><path

		don’t remember the names of the others because they were written

		<q>dǎ bāo,</q> which means <q>in a bag.</q> It worked! Though

		out for a fancy dinner of traditional Beijing food. It was a 
		beautifully decorated restaurant with very good food. Jenny and 
		Claire ordered 10 dishes to share amongst 8 people. A few 
		of them are shown in the gallery below.</p><ul class="gallery" id="f2IG"><li><span class="caption">A mildly sweet date cake</span> <a target="_blank" href="/assets/images/date-cake.jpg" class="image-link">View image</a></li><li><span class="caption">Some colorful steamed

			dip a slice of duck in the soy sauce, and put that slice in 
			the middle of the wrapper with a few pieces of cucumber and 
			green onion. Then you wrap it up and eat it! The sugar (center 
			bowl) is for dipping the fatty roast skin into, if you like.</span> <a target="_blank" href="/assets/images/roast-duck.jpg" class="image-link">View image</a></li></ul></div></section><nav id="navPaging"><a href="/page/6">Feast your eyes on more food →</a></nav><footer class="gray" style="text-align:center">© 2016 David Bacisin</footer><script src="/assets/js/gallery.min.js" defer="defer"></script></body></html>
