		<a name="Life-in-a-Hutong"></a><h2>Life in a Hutong</h2>
		<p>Speaking of alleys: on our way back from exploring the 
		Forbidden City, Ge, Michael and I find ourselves walking right 
		through one!</p>
		
		<p>We walk single file between solid gray walls, hearing only 
		our footsteps on the dusty asphalt. Two motorbikes, and 
		then a rickshaw, honk and speed past us, narrowly missing us, the 
		piles of old furniture, and parked cars. Some segments are 
		barely wide enough to fit one car, let alone two side-by-side. 
		I’m not sure whether I should have my DSLR camera out and 
		visible, because alleys in the United States 
		have a reputation for dumpsters and seedy characters, and now I 
		really don’t know what to expect.</p>
		
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>My first experience in an alley 
		in Beijing</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/first-hutong.jpg">View image</a></figure>
		
		<p>But there are very few other people, and Ge acts like it is 
		perfectly normal and safe to walk through an alley. Someone is 
		selling fresh fruit and vegetables from a few shallow crates 
		under a canopy. Another motorbike passes us and slips through a 
		half-meter wide gap in the fence at the end of the alley; we 
		follow — into the most different environment I could have 
		expected: a lush urban garden with trees and streams.</p>
		
		<p>I have survived my first experience in a hutong.</p>
		
		<p><em>Hutong</em> is the Chinese word for alley, but it means 
		much more than that, as I soon find out. It’s Saturday, and I’m
		on a group tour of the Qinglong (<q>Azure Dragon</q>) Hutong.
		The tour is in Mandarin, but a few friends translate the more 
		interesting bits for us non-Chinese speaking folk.</p>
		
		<p>These alleys are between the traditional courtyard-style 
		residencies of the people who live there. Often hundreds of 
		years old, some hutong communities have come under government 
		protection to prevent their replacement with high-rise 
		apartments or commercial buildings. The Design Service Center of 
		Beijing runs a program that encourages residents of Qinglong 
		Hutong to create public art within the hutong to make it their 
		own and promote community in the area. Interestingly, all 
		hutong communities seem to be surrounded by brick walls, and all 
		of them are painted the same color gray.</p>
		
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>My first view of the Qinglong 
		Hutong includes a large flatbed truck piled high with old 
		bicycles and what appears to be other scrap metal.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/junk-trucks.jpg">View image</a></figure>
		
		<p>The tour guide heads into the alley, stopping here and there 
		to talk about points of interest. The other non-Chinese speakers 
		and I spend most of the following two hours looking around and 
		taking pictures.</p>

			wheelchair or on crutches.</span> <a class="image-link p" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/hutong-door.jpg">View image</a></li></ul>
		
		<p>After about 30 minutes, I feel pretty lost. And hot. 
		Fortunately I brought extra water, and our guide knows the way.
		Finally we return to the Design Service Center to debrief.
		Conclusion? Hutongs in China don’t live up to the bad 
		reputation of alleys in the States. People are friendly and 
		tend to keep to themselves, and while they may be a 
		little crowded with junk and traffic, the rich culture of the 
		hutong makes for a warm and fuzzy, homey feeling.</p>

		<a name="The-Great-Wall-at-Mutianyu"></a><h2>The Great Wall at Mutianyu</h2>
		<p>It’s the second Sunday, and we have most of the day off from 
		the design program, making it <em>the</em> day to check out the 
		Great Wall. We had all gone out the night before for karoake at 
		KTV, and while a few others went clubbing afterward, Ken and I 
		had left so we could wake up at 7 am for a full day of 
		adventuring.</p>
		
		<p>We meet up with Mandy and Jenny. They had nicely arranged for 
		a carpool for the four of us to Mutianyu, a section of the 
		Great Wall that is a little further from Beijing and therefore 
		less crowded.</p>
		
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>The welcome center and 
		ticket booths for the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/mutianyu-entrance.jpg">View image</a></figure>
		
		<p>Tickets in hand, we walk past the gift shops (and a Burger 
		King) to catch a bus. The bus careens up a switchback road to 
		drop us off about a mile closer to the base of the mountain. 
		We chuckle about the herd of people wearing bamboo hats, 
		who appear to be part of a tour group.</p>
		
		<p>There are two ways up the mountain: stairs and chairlift. 
		I’ve just recovered from a bout of food poisoning three days 
		ago, but I’m feeling <em>pretty darn good</em> this 
		morning — and since the others want to hike up, I think,
		sure, I’m athletic, I’ll be able to handle it.</p>
		
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container p"></div><figcaption>This girl,
		however, doesn’t seem quite able to handle it.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/tired-at-mutianyu.jpg">View image</a></figure>
		
		<p>Handle it I do, much better than a number of other tourists.
		The weather is hot, above 90°F and humid, so the four of us are
		soaked with sweat not even a third of the way up. My 1.5-liter 
		water bottle I bought this morning has sure come in handy, as 
		halfway up, Jenny pays three times more for a bottle a third 
		the size. But finally, after weaving through dense forest with 
		an occasional view of the beatiful valley below, we make it to 
		The Wall.</p>
		
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>A stone near the base of the 
		wall, much larger than my hand</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/giant-bricks.jpg">View image</a></figure>
		
		<p>The bricks are huge. We climb thirty or so more stairs to 
		get to the walkway along the top — from which we can see 
		the entire valley on either side, lush with vegetation, and 
		mountains in the distance. We stroll along the uneven square-ish
		cobbles, peeking through crenellations and exploring several 
		towers. The Wall just keeps going; we walk to the next 
		tower, and then the next, and still we can see the Wall zig-zagging
		across the mountain-top, continuing beyond the horizon.</p>
		
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>The Great Wall snakes far into
		the distance, no end in sight. I count ten towers in this photo.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/beyond-horizon.jpg">View image</a></figure>
		
		<p class="text-big" style="max-width:6em">
			<span style="display:block;">yī</span>
			<span style="display:block;padding-left:20%">èr</span>
			<span style="display:block;padding-left:10%">sān</span>
			<span style="display:block;text-align:right">qiézi!</span>
		</p>
		
		<p>Many, many times, whenever people are taking group photos, 
		we hear, <q>yī, èr, sān, qiézi,</q> which literally translates 
		to, <q>one, two, three, eggplant.</q> Just like the word 
		<q>cheese</q> in English, <q>qiézi</q> (roughly chee-ET-zeh) 
		makes you show your smile when you say it.</p>
		
		<p>To get down from the wall, we could walk, take the chairlift, 
		or <em>ride a toboggan</em>. We hike down, which is much 
		easier than going up, but we catch a few entertaining glimpses
		of the shiny metal toboggan chute. The toboggans 
		appear to be very minimal, and the signs we can see 
		through the trees suggest that passengers are responsible for 
		braking around curves.</p>
		
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>A man rides a toboggan down from the
		Great Wall.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/toboggan.jpg">View image</a></figure>
		
		<p>Unfortunately, I don’t learn much more history than I 
		already know (i.e. built to keep out invading forces), but my 
		visit to the Great Wall gives me the perspective of how

		<a name="Back-to-Beijing"></a><h2>Back to Beijing</h2>
		<p>The Great Wall is not our only adventure today: while 
		our friends had set up the carpool to Mutianyu, they have no 
		plan for getting back. After learning from the Welcome Center 
		staff that the next bus would be a while, we wander out and 
		soon encounter an older man soliciting rides into town. Mandy 
		and Jenny speak with him (Ken and I clueless to what is 
		happening), and soon enough we are climbing into the back of a 
		small van. Before we pull onto the road, the driver shouts for 
		and negotiates with another passenger, who takes the front seat.</p>
		
		<p>The ride is certainly fast. Our driver races through the 
		countryside, passing cars on the left <em>and</em> the 
		right — and then slamming on the brakes while passing 
		in the <q>bike</q> lane because, well, there’s a farmer 
		chugging along on a motorized cargo tricycle. But, we make it 
		into town in one piece, pay the driver his 40 yuan, and 
		we get off on the side of the road. He points to the other side 
		of the street, telling us that the crowd there is waiting for 
		the bus.</p>
		
		<p>Despite not a single sign for a bus stop.</p>
		
		<p>We wait for about 15 minutes and sure enough, a public 
		bus arrives! Being mid-afternoon on a Sunday (or maybe just 
		being in Beijing) means that our bus gets stuck in traffic for 
		two hours on the Jingcheng Expressway. Finally, miraculously, 
		we find a subway station. Just over three hours after leaving 
		the Great Wall, we’re back in Zhongguancun.</p>

		<h3>Food</h3>
		<p>I tried a lot of food while in China. Most of it was delicious,
		some of it was not. </p>
		
		lots of pictures of food
		typical meal?
		
		<ul class="gallery" id="f1IG"><li><span class="caption">A traditional Chinese

		<p>One night, Jenny and Claire took us design mentors and faculty
		out for a fancy dinner of traditional Beijing food. It was a 
		beautifully decorated restaurant most of which were very good 
		and deserve to be in their own gallery, below.</p>

		<div class="blue">
		<h3>Water</h3>
		<p><q>Don’t drink the water!</q> my family told me before I left.</p>
		
		<p><q>Do you know not to drink the tap water?</q> the design 
		program organizers told me when I arrived.</p>
		
		<p>One of the most frustrating parts of my experience in China 
		was the fact that the tap water just isn’t safe to drink. 
		The reason? It contains a mix of bacteria and heavy metals. 
		Some people drink boiled tap water, but boiling doesn’t take 
		care of the heavy metals, so I spent a considerable amount of 
		time and money going to the store to buy bottled water. I was 
		quite happy when I discovered the 1.5 liter bottles, which are 
		a little big to carry around but well worth the saved money 
		and effort: I drank about 2 liters total per day, meaning I had 
		to only buy one or two 1.5 L bottles at 3.5 yuan each each day.
		Before I had discovered the big bottles, I was going through 
		about 4 bottles at 2.5 yuan each.</p>
		
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/water-bottles-1200.jpg">View image</a></figure>
		
		<p>I never buy bottled water in the States because one, it costs 
		anywhere from 300 to 2000 times more than tap water; two, the 
		tap water in northeast Ohio regularly exceeds health and safety 
		standards; and three, all of those extra bottles are extremely 
		wasteful, even if they are recycled (recycling helps, but still 
		wastes a lot of energy!). Having worked on several environmental 
		sustainability projects in the past, I felt like I was just 
		<em>slaughtering</em> the environment with how many bottles I 
		bought in China. Sob.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="dust">
		<h3>Smog</h3>
		<p>On that note, the smog was probably tied for the most
		frustrating part of my experience. I could see it when I arrived
		through the window, but I didn’t smell it 
		until I finally got out of the air conditioning. The air felt 
		heavy to breathe, and it was <em>sweet</em>, sweet in a way 
		you don’t ever want it to be, sweet with a mix of car exhaust 
		and cigarette smoke. That first few days were probably the worst
		out of my three weeks there, since a rainstorm on the fourth day 
		cleared up the sky quite a bit.</p>
		
		<p>Beijing is particularly prone to dense smog because the city 
		is surrounded by a mountain range that tends to block the 
		wind — not to mention the population over 20 million and 
		traffic jams caused by the roughly 6 million registered cars. 
		Very few people wear breathing masks, and even I started to get 
		used to breathing the air after a few days. I’d rather not 
		think about all the pollution I inhaled.</p>

		<div>
		<h3>Money</h3>
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/money-1200.jpg">View image</a></figure>
		<p>The currency of the People’s Republic of China is the 
		renminbi, meaning <q>people’s currency</q> and abbreviated 
		<abbr title="renminbi">RMB</abbr>. The <em>yuan</em> (元) is the 
		base unit; there are 10 jiao (角) to 1 yuan; and 
		there are 10 fen (分) to 1 jiao. I never saw any 
		prices or coins in fen, probably because they have so little 
		value. Today, the exchange rate fluctuates between 6 to 7 yuan 
		per 1 United States dollar — but the cost of living 
		in China is also considerably lower.
		A regular 18-ounce bottle of water was typically priced at 2 or 
		3 yuan, 30 to 46 US cents.</p>

		<a name="Olympic-parks"></a><h2>Olympic parks</h2>
		<p>Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics. What happens to a 
		more than $2 billion USD Olympic complex 8 years after the games
		are over? I spent two days exploring the <q>remains.</q></p>
		
		<p>But it turns out that the complex is less of a corpse and 
		more of a tourist attraction. On the first day I was there, 
		a Wednesday <!--TODO confirm-->, there were hundreds of other 
		tourists from all over China (plus a handful of foreigners). 
		The Bird’s Nest stadium, pictured below, was open for tours 
		(for a price of 50 yuan), and has occasionally been used to host 
		sporting events and concerts.</p>
		
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>The Beijing National Stadium was 
		designed by architecture firm Herzog &amp; de Meuron, with 
		consulting by artist Ai Weiwei. Its appearance earns it the
		nickname, <q>The Bird’s Nest.</q></figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/birds-nest.jpg">View image</a></figure>
		
		<p>We walked across the vast expanse of asphalt, over to the 
		aquatic center, nicknamed <q>The Water Cube.</q> The
		blue plastic façade makes the building look like a square blob 
		of soup bubbles, and the plastic panels are translucent to let 
		through light. The building has been transformed into a water 
		park, but we didn’t go inside to check it out. If you, like us, 
		forgot to bring a bathing suit while checking out the Olympic 
		parks, plenty of vendors in the park have some for sale.</p>
		
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>The Beijing National Aquatic 
		Center, or Water Cube, now contains a water park open to the 
		public.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/water-cube.jpg">View image</a></figure>
		
		<p>Heading further north, we wandered past a few more (less 
		architectually-interesting) buildings, under the very cool 
		lamp posts, checked out the public art, and gazed up at the 
		Ling Long pagoda.</p>

		<p>A little more than a week after visiting the Olympic Green,
		I decided to spend a morning exploring Olympic Forest Park, a 
		680-hectare garden park. It was cloudy that day, and at one 
		point drizzly, so I suspect it was less popular than usual.
		I, however, had a very enjoyable time wandering around by 
		myself.</p>
		
		<p>Along the edge of the large, south lake of the park, a few 
		people were feeding the koi fish — and what a strange 
		sight that was! Hundreds of fish swarmed all into one spot, 
		some of them rising much further above the surface of the water 
		than I ever would have expected.</p>
		
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>Koi swarm near the edge of the 
		lake, where people were tossing food pellets.<!-- TODO confirm --></figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/crazy-koi.jpg">View image</a></figure>
		
		<p>After recovering from my shock at the fish frenzy, I started 
		walking around the lake when the dull whirring sound that I had 
		been hearing could no longer be considered <q>dull.</q> Turning 
		down one path, it sounded like a million insects chirping, 
		singing, shrieking? The whirr was loud enough to be painful, yet 
		encompassing in a peaceful solitude away from the bustle of 
		the city. I suspect they were cicadas, but I could never spot 
		one while hearing the sound. Several sections of trees throughout 
		the park would whirr with gusto.</p>
		
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>I did manage to catch a photo of this 
		cicada, though I didn’t hear any whirring at the time.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/cicada.jpg">View image</a></figure>

		<p>After about a half hour, I had kept noticing all sorts of 
		prohibitory signs that were simultaneously intrusive and
		entertaining. They said things like, <q>No climbing,</q> 
		<!--TODO look up park signs-->.</p>
		
		<p>As the drizzle subsided, I decided to climb the hill that 
		overlooked the lake. Why not, with a name like <!-- TODO name of hill -->.
		Unlike the highly-maintained areas that I had just walked through,
		the path up the hill was left to be (slightly) more wild.
		The aroma of pine trees washed over me as a passed through a 
		grove, and I stopped at the first landing for a short time to 
		look over the lake — but, the trees were too tall to see 
		over and I didn’t want to disturb the woman doing yoga, so I 
		continued up the path. By the top, I was even sweatier than I 
		had been at the Great Wall, though well-worth the view of the 
		Olympic Green and city beyond.</p>
		
		<figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>A hazy view from the top of 
		a hill in Olympic Forest Park.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/olympic-vista.jpg">View image</a></figure>
		
		<p>Wanting to finish walking around the lake, I headed back 
		toward the subway stop, getting slightly lost in the extensive
		serpentine paths of the park. At one point, I crossed paths with 
		a mother and her son — and after about a minute of them 
		conversing in Chinese while I took pictures of the scenery, he 
		ran over to me to say <q>Hello!</q> His (English) name was Jack 
		and he was 8 years old; and I think he was excited to practice 
		his English with a foreigner. It was a great way to end my 
		adventure.</p>
		
		<p>The Olympic Green and Forest Park are accessible off of 
		4 stops on line 8 of the subway. While the sports 
		complex offers interesting architecture and entertainment, 
		the huge park, sometimes called the <q>lung</q> of Beijing, 
		is a pleasant respite from the concrete and steel jungle of the 
		dense city.</p>

		<a name="Transportation-taxi"></a><h2>Transportation: taxi</h2>
		<p>I was on my own for the last two days of my time in Beijing.
		The design program had ended and everyone had left, but at least 
		I still could chat online with them. With my flight departing at 
		8:00 am, I needed to find a way to the airport — but the 
		subway opening at 6 am would be too late.</p>
		
		<p>Hacking together a translation, I showed the hotel 
		receptionist my phone, hoping Google Translate would be accurate 
		enough and that my VPN wouldn’t cut out. (A Virtual Private 
		Network is needed to access a number of Western websites, 
		including Google, because China…discourages access to those 
		sites.) A few badly translated words from the receptionist 
		and a few more confusing looks and finally nods from each of us,
		I went back up to my room feeling mostly confident that she 
		would have a taxi ready for me the next morning at 5 a.m.</p>
		
		<p>The next morning, excited to go home, sad to leave, and 
		nervous about navigating the in-between, I triple-checked my 
		luggage and checked out of the hotel. And there, in the little 
		parking lot in front of the hotel, was a taxi!</p>
		
		<p>I showed the driver a map destination of airport terminal 3,
		he nodded, and we were off. An hour (and 122 yuan 
		later — after all, it was quite far across the city), I was 
		checking into my flight to Chicago, with a layover in Shanghai.
		Fortunately, the airport 
		staff speak enough English to help foreign travelers, and I 
		was on my way. Once again over the north Pacific — </p>
