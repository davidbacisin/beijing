		much more than that, as I soon find out. It’s Saturday, and I’m
		on a group tour of the Qinglong (<q>Azure Dragon</q>) Hutong.
		The tour is in Mandarin, but a few friends translate the more 
		interesting bits for us non-Chinese speaking folk.</p><p>These alleys are between the traditional courtyard-style 
		residencies of the people who live there. Often hundreds of 
		years old, some hutong communities have come under government 
		protection to prevent their replacement with high-rise 
		apartments or commercial buildings. The Design Service Center of 
		Beijing runs a program that encourages residents of Qinglong 
		Hutong to create public art within the hutong to make it their 
		own and promote community in the area. Interestingly, all 
		hutong communities seem to be surrounded by brick walls, and all 
		of them are painted the same color gray.</p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>My first view of the Qinglong 
		Hutong includes a large flatbed truck piled high with old 
		bicycles and what appears to be other scrap metal.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/junk-trucks.jpg">View image</a></figure><p>The tour guide heads into the alley, stopping here and there 
		to talk about points of interest. The other non-Chinese speakers 
		and I spend most of the following two hours looking around and 
		taking pictures.</p><ul class="gallery" id="igHT"><li><span class="caption">This blue-green sculpture

		Fortunately I brought extra water, and our guide knows the way.
		Finally we return to the Design Service Center to debrief.
		Conclusion? Hutongs in China don’t live up to the bad 
		reputation of alleys in the States. People are friendly and 
		tend to keep to themselves, and while they may be a 
		little crowded with junk and traffic, the rich culture of the 
		hutong makes for a warm and fuzzy, homey feeling.</p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container p"></div><figcaption>On the way 
		to the 798 Arts District, I took a shortcut through this 
		alley, which didn’t seem to be quite like a traditional 
		residential hutong. It was strangely full of window and door 
		frames.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/hutong-near-798.jpg">View image</a></figure></section><section class="gray"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" viewbox="0 0 1200 300" fill="currentColor"><path d="m 923.03,129.78 -12.61,1.12 -1.76,1.24 -0.44,7.48 -4.1,0.19 0,-8.43 -25.27,2.17 -2.29,0.9 -0.12,7.67 -3.75,0.19 0,-8.28 -24.19,2.15 -2.97,1.01 0,6.75 -3.22,0.18 -0.25,-7.5 -12.93,0.76 -2.07,1.38 0.75,23.86 -3.03,33.85 c 0,0 -11.09,4.56 -32.81,15.65 -21.72,11.13 -55.36,19.12 -78.22,21.26 -22.86,2.15 -97.31,-2.14 -114.81,-4.1 -17.5,-1.97 -39.66,-5.18 -41.63,-5.72 -35.85,-3.6 -67.83,-11.33 -103.75,-15.18 -12.86,-1.44 -76.06,-11.26 -76.06,-11.26 l -2.5,-29.81 0.19,-19.09 -4.66,-3.03 -13.41,-2.16 -0.87,10.53 -1.97,0 0.34,-8.94 -1.59,-2.31 -11.78,-1.43 -0.87,2.34 0,8.4 -1.22,-0.12 0.5,-7.31 -1.25,-4.07 -15.16,-2 0,11.38 -1.78,0 -0.5,-9.09 -1.75,-3.29 -15.16,-2.28 0,12.13 -1.53,-0.5 -0.5,-9.35 -1,-2.53 -17.69,-2.78 -18.93,1.25 0.25,12.13 -7.07,0 0,-12.13 -32.84,1.78 0.5,12.13 -6.81,-0.25 -0.18,-11.89 c 0,0 -30.34,0.63 -30.38,0.75 l -3,2.79 0,9.84 -7.35,-0.25 0.25,-11.35 -18.19,0.5 -4.59,3.6 -4.28,99.28 c -20.75,0.36 -40.05,11.92 -103.403,27.45 -34.279,8.4 -62.742,38.05 -62.742,38.05 L 1212,303.45 1210,277.29 C 1212.4,308.12 1009.1,251 1009.1,251 l -7.8,-94.44 -1.2,-21.72 -13.85,-0.9 -0.55,1.27 0.33,6.32 -1.35,0 -0.1,-7.68 -14.34,-0.93 -0.69,1.58 -0.25,6.26 -1.28,-0.19 0.25,-7.78 -12.69,-0.84 -0.93,1.85 -0.16,6.26 -1.12,0.15 0.28,-8.39 -15.94,-1.03 -0.96,1.74 0,6.66 -1.36,0 0,-8.53 z"></path></svg><a name="The-Great-Wall-at-Mutianyu" aria-hidden="true"></a><h2>The Great Wall at Mutianyu</h2><p>It’s the second Sunday, and we have most of the day off from 
		the design program, making it <em>the</em> day to check out the 
		Great Wall. We had all gone out the night before for karoake at 
		KTV, and while a few others went clubbing afterward, Ken and I 
		had left so we could wake up at 7 am for a full day of 
		adventuring.</p><p>We meet up with Mandy and Jenny. They had nicely arranged for 
		a carpool for the four of us to Mutianyu, a section of the 
		Great Wall that is a little further from Beijing and therefore 
		less crowded.</p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>The welcome center and 
		ticket booths for the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/mutianyu-entrance.jpg">View image</a></figure><p>Tickets in hand, we walk past the gift shops (and a Burger 
		King) to catch a bus. The bus careens up a switchback road to 
		drop us off about a mile closer to the base of the mountain. 
		We chuckle about the herd of people wearing bamboo hats, 
		who appear to be part of a tour group.</p><p>There are two ways up the mountain: stairs and chairlift. 
		I’ve just recovered from a bout of food poisoning three days 
		ago, but I’m feeling <em>pretty darn good</em> this 
		morning — and since the others want to hike up, I think,
		sure, I’m athletic, I’ll be able to handle it.</p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container p"></div><figcaption>This girl,
		however, doesn’t seem quite able to handle it.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/tired-at-mutianyu.jpg">View image</a></figure><p>Handle it I do, much better than a number of other tourists.
		The weather is hot, above 90°F and humid, so the four of us are
		soaked with sweat not even a third of the way up. My 1.5-liter 
		water bottle I bought this morning has sure come in handy, as 
		halfway up, Jenny pays three times more for a bottle a third 
		the size. But finally, after weaving through dense forest with 
		an occasional view of the beatiful valley below, we make it to 
		The Wall.</p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>A stone near the base of the 
		wall, much larger than my hand</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/giant-bricks.jpg">View image</a></figure><p>The bricks are huge. We climb thirty or so more stairs to 
		get to the walkway along the top — from which we can see 
		the entire valley on either side, lush with vegetation, and 
		mountains in the distance. We stroll along the uneven square-ish
		cobbles, peeking through crenellations and exploring several 
		towers. The Wall just keeps going; we walk to the next 
		tower, and then the next, and still we can see the Wall zig-zagging
		across the mountain-top, continuing beyond the horizon.</p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>The Great Wall snakes far into
		the distance, no end in sight. I count ten towers in this photo.</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/beyond-horizon.jpg">View image</a></figure><p style="font-size:2em;max-width:6em"><span style="display:block;">yī</span><span style="display:block;padding-left:20%">èr</span><span style="display:block;padding-left:10%">sān</span><span style="display:block;text-align:right">qiézi!</span></p><p>Many, many times, whenever people are taking group photos, 
		we hear, <q>yī, èr, sān, qiézi,</q> which literally translates 
		to, <q>one, two, three, eggplant.</q> Just like the word 
		<q>cheese</q> in English, <q>qiézi</q> (roughly chee-ET-zeh) 
		makes you show your smile when you say it.</p><p>To get down from the wall, we could walk, take the chairlift, 
		or <em>ride a toboggan</em>. We hike down, which is much 
		easier than going up, but we catch a few entertaining glimpses
		of the shiny metal toboggan chute. The toboggans 
		appear to be very minimal, and the signs we can see 
		through the trees suggest that passengers are responsible for 
		braking around curves.</p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>A man rides a toboggan down from the

		already know (i.e. built to keep out invading forces), but my

		and the workers who still climb up to it everyday.</p><ul class="gallery" id="gwIG"><li><span class="caption">Because of the elevation
