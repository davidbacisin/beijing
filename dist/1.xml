I’ve just gotten off a 12 ½ hour flight from 
		Chicago, after learning what a <q>short-checked bag</q> is and 
		stepping onto a Boeing 747 for the first time. I had spent
		an hour and a half in Chicago waiting for my luggage to show up 
		from my Cleveland flight, grabbed a quarter-pounder with cheese 
		for lunch from McDonald’s, and gotten my visa approved with a 
		<q>DOCS OK</q> stamp at the gate. Now that I am here, 
		in Beijing, I have no idea where to go, but I let my aching legs 
		follow the crowd of people along hundreds of meters of terminal 
		walkway.</p><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>My boarding pass with <q>DOCS OK</q> stamp</figcaption><a class="image-link" target="_blank" href="/assets/images/docs-ok.jpg">View image</a></figure><p>As I look out the expansive windows of Beijing Capital
		International Airport, 
		I wonder how the pilot could have seen to land: the outside air 
		is thick with yellowish-white smog. Still walking, walking, 
		looking for  some indication of what to do next — but 
		finally the ceiling swells upward, and there are the lines.</p><p>I scan the signs: Chinese nationals, no, diplomatic, no, 
		immigration, possibly, transits out of this terminal, no, 
		transits out a different terminal, still no, no more planes 
		right now, please — so I get in the long line for 
		immigration. I fill out the immigration card, pose for the 
		picture, and get stamped through. Success!</p><aside><h4>Traveler’s Tip.</h4> US Citizens must apply in advance for a Chinese visa. This 
		could take a week or two, and I would recommend applying even a 
		month before you leave to avoid expedite fees.</aside><p>Once again wandering and wondering, I spot a sign that says, 
		<q>Baggage claim: Take train to T3.</q> Train? TRAIN?
		I take the escalator past the sign and sure enough, light rail 
		trains are carting people off the platform — but judging 
		by a few others’ facial expressions, I’m not the only one 
		confused by the whole system. I pile onto the next train, 
		wonder who is driving because I sure don’t see a place for 
		a driver to sit, and ten minutes later arrive at Terminal 3.</p><p>There are a disturbing lack of signs for baggage claim.</p><p>Following the crowd, I enter a huge room with the largest and 
		longest bag carousels I’ve ever seen. After 15 minutes I spot my
		bag and yank it from the pile, then head over to something that 
		looks like an exit…but only sort of. It says, <q>Customs,</q> 
		but not many people are going through it — I read the signs 
		again and glance around, and there, a hundred meters away on the
		other side of the room, are the <em>very large</em> <q>Customs</q> 
		signs, with a much longer line of people. I roll my luggage over, 
		double-check that I had nothing to declare, step through
		the metal detectors, and then send my baggage through the X-ray 
		scanner. With no response from the security personnel 
		(is it OK to go? Yes? No?), I loiter a few seconds and then 
		decide to continue on, through a maze of hallways until — </p><p>Railings groan as they hold back hundreds of people, like 
		levees in a flood. I see faces, signs, more faces and more 
		signs, but no one I recognize and none holding my name. I am 
		supposed to call someone named Chen — whom I’ve never 
		met — to pick me up from the airport, but I 
		certainly don’t have cell service. Finally, as I come to the 
		end of the parted sea, I hear someone say,</p><p><q>David?</q></p><p>I look around and see one familiar face, a face I have seen only 
		once before in a picture from a conference call: Michael. 
		Michael introduces me to the person standing next to him, Jesse, 
		who has replaced Chen at the last minute. C’est la vie.</p><p>Jesse leads us to his car, and his driver — yes, this 
		Chinese twentysomething has a driver — shimmies us through 
		traffic to our destination: the Haidian district.</p></section><section class="yellow"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 1200 300" fill="currentColor"><path d="m 748,230.3 c 43.4,0 36.6,51 36.6,51 0,0 28.3,0.5 32.6,-2 4.2,-2.5 6.9,-3.7 5,-10.1 -1.7,-5.8 3,-3 3,-17.2 0,-14.1 -7.5,-40 -61.1,-45.9 -69.4,-7.6 -101,-48 -153.8,-51 -30.8,-1.8 -104.5,-7.8 -152.8,16.1 -38.2,18.9 -71.6,15.5 -71.6,15.5 0,0 0.5,30.9 -5.2,39.2 -3.5,5.1 -7,5.7 -7,5.7 0,0 -6.9,31.7 20.7,37.1 23.1,4.6 30.8,5.8 30.8,5.8 0,0 -3.4,-44.7 38.9,-44.7 42.3,0 38.2,50.3 38.2,50.3 l 206,1.2 c 0,0 -3.7,-51 39.7,-51 z"></path><circle cx="464" cy="268" r="32"></circle><circle cx="748" cy="268" r="32"></circle></svg><a name="Crosstown-Traffic" aria-hidden="true"></a><h2>Crosstown Traffic</h2><figure class="image-fig"><div class="image-container"></div><figcaption>Eight lanes of traffic near the
